  <scene id="1" in="00:00:00.00" out="00:00:02.01"> Heather: All
    right. Go ahead. <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="2" in="00:00:02.02" out="00:00:07.27"> Nicolas: My name
    is Nicolas Schapira, class of 2001 and I currently live in New York City. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="3" in="00:00:07.28" out="00:00:11.20"> Heather: Awesome.
    All right, so is there something specific that you want to talk about? <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="4" in="00:00:11.21" out="00:00:14.04"> Nicolas: Not
    particularly, whatever questions you might have. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="5" in="00:00:14.05" out="00:00:19.26"> Heather: All
    right, one of the things I’m curious about is, what brought you to Grinnell?
    <speaker>NS</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="6" in="00:00:19.27" out="00:01:06.06"> Nicolas: It was
    interesting, because coming from, I was living in New York City at the time, and a bunch of my
    classmates were all obsessed with staying on the east coast and, or going to state school.
    Mostly because people felt it was more affordable, and state schools in New York are pretty
    good. I wanted to separate myself from everybody else, and I wanted to have a completely
    different experience than a large university. I went to a huge high school. My graduating class
    was 1,000 kids, so I just wanted something completely different. So instead I was looking at
    some of the view books that were, that I was getting sent after the SATs and PSATs came out and
    I got Grinnell and I said, “Ooh, Iowa! Nobody would believe I would go there!” and so I applied
    and they came back, they offered me pretty good financial aid package and they offered to fly me
    over. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="7" in="00:01:06.07" out="00:01:47.13"> Nicolas: When I
    came here it was spring waltz, it was that first nice weekend of the year. Everybody was the
    happiest that they could have possibly have been, people were outside. They were dancing in the
    streets, on Mac Field, and it really made me think, “This is a great place that I want to spend
    my next four years at.” Granted, I didn’t get to see winter at the time, but all things
    considered, that experience I had that weekend, plus the financial aid plus everything else
    really made me feel as if it were a unique experience from my high school- that- what I had in
    high school. I was really excited to come when I visited. <speaker>NS</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="8" in="00:01:47.14" out="00:01:49.29"> Heather: Yeah.
    What were your first memories of Grinnell? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="9" in="00:01:50.00" out="00:02:30.26"> Nicolas: First
    memories was that Prospie weekend, sitting in a van coming from the airport I met three people
    who ended up being my friends all through Grinnell and today, one of whom is running around
    campus at the moment. But, it was all of us from all different parts; we were from Chicago, New
    York, DC, and we were all just taking about our high school experiences and it was funny because
    we all had similar feelings. We all wanted to cut the proverbial umbilical cord, have a
    completely different set of experiences and I remember thinking, “These are the type of people I
    want to spend time with.” And over the years just how we fomented relationships just really
    always stands out in my mind and really to me epitomizes the Grinnell experience.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="10" in="00:02:30.27" out="00:02:38.26"> Heather: Yeah.
    That's great. Was there a professor, student, or staff member during your time here that had a
    strong influence on you? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="11" in="00:02:38.27" out="00:03:33.13"> Nicolas: Yeah,
    there were two, both of whom were fellow students. One, her name was Jessie Isomoto class of
    ’98. She was an education major at Grinnell. She ended up becoming- doing education program- for
    whatever reason she chose not to go into the classroom after she finished her program, instead
    got a job at Teach for America, and so when I graduated I needed a job and I wanted to go into
    the nonprofit sector, and so she hooked me up with a temp job there. I worked there doing random
    odd administrative things, but after talking with her and talking with all the other alums that
    were working with Teach for America as an organization, I really became motivated towards their
    mission insofar as ensuring educational opportunities for all types of students. And so, that
    really very much led me to join the program or to apply for it. And then I got in and then I
    became a teacher teaching Bilingual Special Ed. in the South Bronx. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="12" in="00:03:33.14" out="00:03:34.17"> Heather: Wow.
    <speaker>NS</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="13" in="00:03:34.18" out="00:04:13.08"> Nicolas: And,
    being able to talk to her throughout that process, and her really motivating me to do that,
    Teach for America ended up being one of the most powerful life experiences I’ve ever had. All
    the things that make me the person who I am today was influenced by that, and it was all because
    of somebody out – she was four years ahead of me, I only knew her for one year here. But we kept
    in touch over the years and she was always supporting me and telling me you should do these
    types of things because you have the personality for it. That really got in my whole career
    trajectory, as well as really fomenting who I am and what my passions are and how I express
    those passions. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="14" in="00:04:13.09" out="00:04:57.07"> Nicolas: She was
    one. Another one on a similar vein was Carlos Eduardo Mercias. He was class of ‘90... no, ’99
    and he was very instrumental in really pushing me to be a leader. He saw I was committed. He saw
    I had passion. He was really the first person that said, “You have the passion. You have some
    raw talent. These are the types of things you can and should do in order to foment and build
    yourself up.” So he really pushed me into leadership, community leadership, and really focusing
    on what ended up being my commitment to social justice, specifically with the Latino community
    but also overall. So those two individuals who have continually supported me and always been
    people for me to bounce off of, really have most positively impacted me. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="15" in="00:04:57.08" out="00:05:01.01"> Heather: What
    are your best or strongest memories of your time at Grinnell? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="16" in="00:05:01.02" out="00:05:54.24"> Nicolas: The
    rand– and this is very trite, but the random conversations you have about the most random
    things. The fact that, it’d be two in the morning, we all have papers due the next day and then
    we’re frustrated about something, and then we just start talking. We would go from talking about
    mundane professors or classes to then moving over and saying,saying,"This is what’s wrong with
    things here. This is how it affects us in a society, and this is what society has- This is how
    we experience society." Having those types of conversations and saying, "We wanna make change.
    We wanna influence change." And then really starting to get together as groups, one of the
    things, one of those conversations that I ended up having ended up in the creation of a
    nonprofit that we started when we were still students. It was based out of Des Moines working
    with Latino youth and at-risk Latino youth. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="17" in="00:05:54.25" out="00:06:41.01"> Nicolas: It was
    those series of conversations that we had over the course of 2 or 3 years that really allowed us
    to come together and really say, "We’re tired of talking about this. Let’s do something," and
    the fact that that happens so often here and in so many ways is one of the most potent
    experiences I had, and one of the major reasons why I would always tell somebody you should go
    there, because only here do you end up having those types of conversations. Not only are you
    talking about what you’re learning in class but you’re also thinking about, "Well, what does
    this really mean?" And that wasn’t a level of conversation I ever had even before and after.
    Just those academic, intensive pseudo-philosophical conversations, 'cause they ended up really
    being practical. So those are some of my potent, most potent memories that I really look fondly
    on. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="18" in="00:06:41.02" out="00:06:46.26"> Heather: How do
    you feel like Grinnell fostered that spirit of activism? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="19" in="00:06:46.27" out="00:07:49.26"> Nicolas: I think
    it all boiled down to self-governance. The idea is, you are empowered to do whatever you wanna
    do. But we’re not gonna do it for you! So the idea is, for example there was... In order for any
    community irrespective of what your basis was, so for example, be it at, quote-on-quote- not
    esoteric, that’s not the word I want to use. Be it something at- artsy, like for example
    crochet. I know there’s a huge crocheting club that ended up growing and growing because
    somebody crocheted and wanted to show others how to crochet. So doing something as practical as
    that, and then looking at the multicultural groups on campus, which I was a huge part of during
    my four years here, and looking at well, "Here’s a community. What as a community do you wanna
    do?" You can either just do social things. You can do activist things. You can raise questions
    to each other and to the campus as a whole, and really having the freedom because nothing was
    implemented from administration other than, "Here’s some money. Do stuff with it," but you have
    to ask for it first. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="20" in="00:07:49.27" out="00:08:49.07"> Nicolas: Those
    processes really forced you to say, "OK, so first what op I wanna do? How am I gonna get money
    for it, and then how am I gonna implement it make it worthwhile for everyone?" And those, that
    spirit of what Grinnell fomented so far as you can do whatever you want, really empowered that
    sense of, "OK, if we’re gonna do something, what will that mean?" And then you have to talk and
    converse and end up being very active. And the thing about it is once one group gets active,
    it’s, it’s the proverbial sense of nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd, right? So you have one
    crowd of people doing something, and you always think, "Hey, I can do that too about something
    that matters to me." So once you have that one group that’s active, and on some levels it was
    something as simple as the student body, Student Government. Once you have SGA that implements
    policy in some way, shape or form for the student body, there’s always gonna be another group
    of, "I wanna do something else." And that really fosters it. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="21" in="00:08:49.08" out="00:09:20.22"> Nicolas: I think
    it all boils down to the student governance and the SGA because those really influenced us
    specifically in the communities that I was a part of saying, "We’re going to do something
    different because what they’re doing isn’t stuff that caters to my likes. It’s not gonna happen
    unless I say, and/or do something." So that was one of my favorite things about Grinnell, is
    that I was really empowered to essentially do whatever crazy ideas I wanted so long as I could
    convince people to do it with me. So it really foments leadership, which I loved about my
    experience. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="22" in="00:09:20.23" out="00:09:28.22"> Heather: How- in
    what other ways did self-governance impact your life? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="23" in="00:09:28.23" out="00:10:22.12"> Nicolas: We got
    to assist in the hiring of all faculty and staff, so I, we were part of a larger, like for
    example I was a PoliSci major, so whenever they brought in- I don’t wanna say temporary ‘cause I
    don’t remember what the term is. Sorry, I forgot all the acronyms. Whenever they bring a staff
    member to do a presentation we got to go and write feedback. "Do we want this person here or
    not?" So it really gave me a sense of, "I’m empowered to figure out what type of education I
    want," which was fabulous to me. I was also part of the, a student committee that hired student
    staff- I mean, sorry, RLCs. So, I would go to some of the conventions around the area and then
    do interviews and do interviews here, and really engaged in saying, "This is the type of person
    that when I’m at the lowest of the low I wanna go talk to with my problems." So- be it tiny or
    large. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="24" in="00:10:22.13" out="00:10:49.29"> Nicolas: So,
    that was, again, very empowering and that’s all part of the philosophy of student governance.
    Being able to feel as if I’m empowered – I know I’m abusing the term – to positively affect the
    community really really really enabled me to join these and say, "I wanna do this and I want,
    not only to make my life better but those of my fellow students better." I think that really-
    that part of the process was very important to me. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="25" in="00:10:50.00" out="00:10:55.18"> Heather: Yeah,
    that's great. What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
    <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="26" in="00:10:55.19" out="00:11:34.25"> Nicolas: Some of
    the things I remember most about Grinnell are walking to the pub, obviously when I was of age
    thank you very much. I never went to the pub underage. I was one of the few, but I never did.
    And, all of the sights, thinking... Often-times when I was in the college, to me the town was
    something to have to go through because, I’m from New York City. It was a huge place and I never
    really, for most of my time at Grinnell I never really appreciated the town and what it offered.
    At one point one of my peers, after they graduated wanted to stick around for a while. So then
    they, they started working at the Dairy Barn, so that really forced me to go to town a lot more.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="27" in="00:11:34.26" out="00:12:18.08"> Nicolas: My
    senior year, one of my friends moved off-campus and had their own place and it was really an
    opportunity for me to every day walk out of town, go to the local businesses, see what’s out
    there. Specifically, I remember when, my senior year, I think Saint’s Roast is the name of the
    place, when it opened up and it was a great cute café that had more than just a bunch of college
    students that I saw all the time. I have fond memories of that, and plus it was a complete
    different level of coffee than we had here, so. I was never a Bob’s person ‘cause it was too far
    south for me, I generally was a North Campus person, so it really enabled me to do some of that.
    Going to the pub really, also, I remember also talking to a lot of "townies", in quotation
    marks, but really just seeing some of their experiences. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="28" in="00:12:18.09" out="00:13:14.00"> Nicolas: The
    other things I really liked is being able to go off-campus and visit professors at their houses
    whenever they did things for their classes or what-not. The houses here are beautiful. I love
    the houses. Those are the things I remember the most, moreso than even downtown. I remember
    professor’s houses and where they are. Another powerful memory I have of Grinnell as a town or
    as an environment was one time, I was part of the Jewish community here on campus and we were
    decorating the Sukkah and we wanted fruits of harvest so me and a peer took bikes to- biked all
    the way to a professor’s house, I don’t remember who the professor is. They have a huge ranch
    and we walk- we pedaled through a gravel road - it was the first time I'd ever pedaled on gravel
    road - all the way out. It must’ve been like five miles. We went to a huge cornfield which I’d
    never been on before ‘cause it’s my freshman year, and we started detasseling corn and then
    taking some of the stalks that were already flat and then we had to ride all the way back.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="29" in="00:13:14.01" out="00:14:03.11"> Nicolas: I saw
    cows, sheep, llamas, alpacas. It was just such a surreal experience for me. 'Cause that, that’s
    when it really hit me: We’re rural. Because there are some ranches and farms in suburban New
    York but nothing like here, where it’s just as far as the eye can see. So, that I really enjoyed
    on some level as well. The only other real memory I have of town is some of the restaurants.
    Going to China Sea, which one of my friends loved the General Tso’s at China Sea. I never got it
    but he loved it and swore by it. Even to today, he hasn’t’ been here in twelve years. Going to
    Café Phoenix, and then some of the pizzerias in town. Really the older I got here, the more I
    went out into town and saw things and really realized that there is more to Grinnell than just
    the College. So yeah. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="30" in="00:14:03.12" out="00:14:05.18"> Heather: How has
    Grinnell changed since you were a student? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="31" in="00:14:05.19" out="00:14:46.16"> Nicolas:
    Buildings, buildings, buildings. The JRC is a phenomenal structure, and it really makes me
    jealous because I was part of a student space committee that helped develop some of the spaces
    at the JRC and seeing some of those spaces and seeing what they do really really really makes me
    think, goodness gracious how things have changed. Other things have changed too. Some of the, I
    was able here to speak to some students and some of the things about student life have changed.
    There’s no longer that separation because of the- what, I would not say dormitory. What, oh
    gosh, cafeteria you ate at, those things have changed. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="32" in="00:14:46.17" out="00:15:39.14"> Nicolas: The
    East Campus, so much changed the dynamic because people say, "This type of person lives there,
    this type of person-" So what some of those definitions are have changed, but those are all
    little things that you only care about when you’re at Grinnell, when you’re an undergrad. Once
    you leave you’re just like, “Y’know, that was kind of silly.” But, in the interim, or rather,
    after that and looking back it’s just seeing some of those, how physical structures affect
    social life in some way, shape or form for better and for worse. That’s in the short, in the one
    or two days I’ve been here the most powerful thing is, “Oh my gosh that’s a big building, in the
    middle of campus and it’s not Darby.” Seeing how that just- experiencing that has been awesome
    for me, just seeing that type of space and how it changed- how it apparently- it really did
    change the campus as a whole. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="33" in="00:15:39.15" out="00:15:43.07"> Heather: What
    kind of physical spaces in the JRC did you help to design? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="34" in="00:15:43.08" out="00:16:41.12"> Nicolas: The
    multicultural spaces specifically. I remember talking about how they would integrate with some
    of the other spaces they were thinking about, like how the cafeteria would be in there for, if
    you have the cafeteria you need the other separate kitchen spaces so how are those gonna relate
    to both the multicultural students, ‘cause we used them a lot when we were on campus, as well as
    the rest of the campus and how do we make those spaces integrate? And, so I was really involved
    in some of that conversation, and specific planning of what it’d look like, how big they are,
    what they would have, talking to architects, looking – and then, that was, that conversation
    began before the master plan began. So then once the master plan came it just shifted into high
    gear and talking to the master planners and everything else and seeing how these are all gonna
    fit together was a really phenomenal thing for me even though it generally meant 7 AM meetings
    at Cowles, which, when your earliest class is at noon is a little difficult.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="35" in="00:16:41.13" out="00:17:19.17"> Nicolas: But,
    that was very important for me ‘cause I knew how important some of these spaces were and how
    important it would be to have these spaces both together and separate, and how important it
    would be to have- for students to have the opportunity to engage their own cultures in a very
    different way that wasn’t happening at the forum. So, that was just awesome and I really wish I
    would- I was able to enjoy it as a student but I walked by there earlier today and I just, they
    look phenomenal. They really look phenomenal and I’m very happy that students today get to enjoy
    that. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="36" in="00:17:19.18" out="00:17:36.24"> Heather: When you were student, how did the geographical layout of campus affect the student life?
    Nicolas: Wow, I can’t believe I just forgot, what’s the name of the street that separates, physically separates
    all the academic buildings from North Campus?
    Heather: 8th. <speaker>Heather Riggs &amp; Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="37" in="00:17:36.25" out="00:18:14.25"> Nicolas: 8th.
    8th was like, complete... They could’ve put a wall there sometimes, it felt, because North and
    South Campus were so far apart. I spent freshman year on, living in Younker North Campus. Second
    year I lived on one of the campus houses. Third year I lived in Spanish House, fourth year I’ve
    lived in Loose. I’ve never felt so separated from most of my friends who are historically North
    Campus people when I was living in Loose. They never came to visit me, and it was- and I’m like,
    "OK seriously? I know it’s twenty below... It’s five minutes, not even. Five minutes on your
    hands and knees, it’s not that far, people." <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="38" in="00:18:14.26" out="00:18:57.12"> Nicolas: I think
    we get, we tend to get lazy. We like to have things where they are. One of the reason most of us
    went to, came to, well not most of us. One of the major reasons people will go to Grinnell is
    ‘cause it’s not, you don’t have to drive from one end of campus to the other. But, I feel like
    that was such an artificial demarcation because the cultures were supposedly so different. They
    were really weren’t; those lines were always blurry no matter what. Some people just happen to
    like to have the loggia available, which is why I went to Loose my senior year. Some people
    preferred the closeness to Cowles. Some people preferred one dining hall over the other. But I
    think that always separated the two, and I felt like people enforced that themselves for no good
    reason, really. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="39" in="00:18:57.13" out="00:19:42.07"> Nicolas: While
    there were people on both North and South Campus I didn’t necessarily like to associate with, it
    was nothing that deep that really should have meant, “Oh, I’m not going there.” But we, when
    we’re students we have these preconceived notions for whatever reason that we like to enforce.
    And sometimes it was enforced, when I told people I was living in Loose they were like, “ 'Gasp'
    Noooooooo! I can’t believe you’re going all the way there!” and I was like, “Really? It’s the
    northern-most one and it’s a really nice dorm. I loved Loose; awesome dorm. Nice rooms, big
    rooms, four bathrooms per floor, really there was nothing not to like. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="40" in="00:19:42.08" out="00:19:45.23"> Heather: What
    were your favorite places on campus. <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="41" in="00:19:45.24" out="00:20:18.04"> Nicolas:
    Favorite places on campus. That’s hard. I ended up spending a lot of time in ARH, just because a
    lot of my classes were there. Amazingly enough I was a social science person and half my social
    science classes were always in Noyce, ‘cause the classrooms were nicer. The whole sliding boards
    thing was just awesome, I loved that. But really I think, any place where we ended up
    congregating I think was the most important thing ‘cause to me when I was here, I loved just
    spending time with my peers. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="42" in="00:20:18.05" out="00:20:52.20"> Nicolas: Spanish
    House will always have a place in my heart ‘cause even when I wasn’t living there I always knew
    someone in Spanish House. So I spent an inordinate amount of time in that specific location, and
    it was one place I knew I could talk Spanish in. It was the one place where, there was a kitchen
    where a bunch of us could come together and just be. It had a beautiful living room, a TV, and
    especially when I was living there we made it a social hub for our group of friends. People
    would always know, no matter what time of day, no matter who or what was around, there was
    always someone to be around. So that will by far have the fondest memory in my heart.

  <scene id="43" in="00:20:52.21" out="00:21:24.18"> Nicolas: The
    Forum also, because it's one of those places where you knew, "I don’t know where anybody is, I’m
    gonna go to the Forum, see who’s there." So that was always awesome, especially when I was
    living on South Campus when I didn’t know where people were, and this was before cell phones on
    campus so you couldn’t just ask, "Where are you?" You just kinda have to search campus, you
    always knew there was a couple of places where you could always find people. One of ‘em was ARH
    in the computer lab, another one was the Forum, another was Spanish House. So those will always
    have fond places in my heart. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="44" in="00:21:24.19" out="00:21:30.18"> Heather: How do
    you feel your class was distinct from classes before and then classes after it?
    <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="45" in="00:21:30.19" out="00:22:06.17"> Nicolas: We were
    the first large class at Grinnell. I wanna say we had like 300+ our first year, and the class
    before us was 200-something, so that was the first big jump insofar as the college wanting to
    become larger so that it can have better and more academic programs to justify their existence.
    So we, like everybody, I remember from seniors down they’re like, “You guys are biiiig,” and
    because the support system wasn’t there yet for our class, a lot of my students ended up – a lot
    of students from my class left. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="46" in="00:22:06.18" out="00:22:36.14"> Nicolas: I wanna
    say only 280 graduated. There’s a large attrition rate my year. Some of it was people deferring,
    people took a year off which happens no matter what. But I think we were that first class of the
    new generation of Grinnell insofar as we were the first class that had the webmail. We were the
    first class that, where they started changing some of the computer policies and I just feel like
    a lot of changes occurred during our time. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="47" in="00:22:36.15" out="00:23:16.12"> Nicolas: Pam
    Ferguson left, Russell Osgood came on. We got to see so many changes; the beginning of the space
    committee and the master plan. We were, we saw what it was and we saw what it was going to be in
    many ways, and I feel like that really affected our, not our, our mind – not, mindset isn’t the
    word I’m looking for but I think it really affected our perspective. ‘Cause we, by the time we
    were seniors people were like, “What was VAX?” and those types of things. So they didn’t get to
    see and appreciate some of the changes that were going on that we got to experience. So I think
    that was a big deal in many ways for our class. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="48" in="00:23:16.13" out="00:23:35.24"> Heather: Is
    there, I know you said that there- you couldn’t think of an answer but is there something that
    was meaningful to you that is no longer available?
    Nicolas: I mean, I was thinking about this earlier and one of the big things that was gone was VAX.
    Heather: That was the computer system?
    <speaker>Heather Riggs &amp; Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="49" in="00:23:35.25" out="00:24:15.11"> Nicolas: That
    was the computer system, so it was text-based. It was before webmail and that was interesting
    because for a couple of years plans didn’t’ exist anymore, and this was pre-facebook,
    pre-myspace, and one of the ways we all kept tabs on each other as far as what was going on for
    us was on our plan. And so it was really the first sense of social media on campus and when they
    VAX went away, a lot of us were lost, so to speak. By the, there were some seniors in my class
    that really brought it back and made it its current web format. I know it had a completely
    different genesis which I’m not really sure of at this point, but that was a big deal for us,
    insofar as what changed, however, it changed for the better so I’m not gonna complain about
    that. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="50" in="00:24:15.12" out="00:25:11.02"> Nicolas: What’s
    new for me, completely foreign, is the p-card system where everything’s on one card, and that
    was kinda weird. ‘Cause I remember when they first put in the proximity cards. Some of us got
    the stereotypical Grinnell paranoia, like “Now they’re gonna know exactly where I am at any
    given time ‘cause my card’s associated with me and they’re gonna know if I’m missing class or
    whatever!” Just stuff that's, at the end of the day, completely ridiculous but it’s what our
    perspective was insofar as, “They’re always out to get us, and we always have to fight against
    them!” It was just a fascinating dynamic, but the fact that I’m sure people can no longer cheat
    the system insofar as, we used to have little plastic chips that we used to spend five dollars
    on and I think one chip essentially ended up being fifty cents that you would have to push in to
    do laundry and dry. And so there was a trick with the old washer-dryers that if you had
    needle-nose pliers, you can push the card in and then yank it out and use the same card over and
    over again. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="51" in="00:25:11.03" out="00:25:54.23"> Nicolas: Almost
    everybody on campus did it in some way shape or form, but the problem with that is people would
    do it wrong and the machines would constantly break. So I understand why they moved away from
    that but it was one of those things where you're just like, "Wow you spent five dollars for four
    years of laundry." But unfortunately y’know, that went away but those were all just small
    things. I think, if anything might’ve changed that might be upsetting to me insofar as what was
    and what isn’t is some of the, some of the student organizations. I know student organizations
    come and go and how some of them change and the tone change, and I don’t wanna necessarily be
    specific at the moment but I know the tone of some of the organizations that are here now aren’t
    what they used to be. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="52" in="00:25:54.24" out="00:27:00.23"> Nicolas: That
    just makes me sad because some of those organizations were vital in my ability to maintain my
    sanity at Grinnell. Some of the student groups that were really supportive of me and gave me
    everything I needed when things were rough for me have completely different tones now and don’t
    do the things they used to do for students, and it’s really upsetting because I know I wouldn’t
    have survived without it. So seeing, it’s more of, and this always happened, they always talked
    about it. Because student groups are purely student-based and are run by students, it forces the
    students to always maintain not only tradition, but maintain energy, and energy comes and goes
    based on generation. I’d always heard from, y’know when you graduate you often keep your finger
    on the pulse or try to, and just to hear some of the conversation about what certain student
    groups are like now v five, ten years ago is somewhat upsetting to me because I know students
    need those, need those services from each other and they’re just not offering it to each other.
    That’s just really sad. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="53" in="00:27:00.24" out="00:27:06.09"> Heather: How
    would you compare the students of today with students from- your classmates?
    <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="54" in="00:27:06.10" out="00:27:45.14"> Nicolas: It’s
    hard to say. It, they’re coming from somewhat different places, it’s really, I don’t, I haven’t
    had as much of an opportunity to speak with new students as I would like. I met a couple
    yesterday, I met a couple Friday. Some of the difference is, because – people who came to
    Grinnell when I came to Grinnell came because it was one of the cheapest, best schools in the
    country and by having some of the policies we have now, despite the fact that many students end
    up paying less than they would have when I went, there is a certain stigma that attaches to a
    school that is considered one of the cheapest to one of the more expensive.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="55" in="00:27:45.15" out="00:28:12.13"> Nicolas: I think
    that inherently changes the student body, so the student body I feel, socioeconomically, is a
    little different now than it was when I was a student. I’m not, I can’t put judgment dow. I
    don't know if it's better. I don’t know if it’s worse. I just know that it’s different and
    therefore I’m hearing students speak about some of the experiences they have are completely
    different. A lot of that deals with the student organizations I was talking about, and some of
    the services that the student organizations used to give them that they don’t.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="56" in="00:28:12.14" out="00:28:57.24"> Nicolas:
    Specifically, what I’ve kept my finger on the pulse for are multicultural groups and the thing
    that students expressed to me, or the few that I’ve spoken to, is that some of the student
    groups aren’t as active as they used to be and there isn’t a sense of unity for these groups
    that there used to be. And one of the things- and that has pluses and minuses to it. I’m not
    gonna say it’s a bad thing. I have no right to say it’s a bad thing. It's just different and it
    really does change campus life in even the smallest of ways. So, I think the difference between
    socioeconomic class on some levels, ‘cause not all, and I think some of the changes in the
    student groups really defines us differently. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="57" in="00:28:57.25" out="00:29:29.04"> Nicolas: I feel
    like, a majority of us, specifically within the Latino community, were very much very loud,
    activist, had bad reputations among the faculty and staff because sometimes we were obnoxious
    for the sake of being obnoxious but things mattered to us in a specific way. Specifically
    multicultural affairs mattered to us and I feel like there was a really strong activism. In many
    cases it was antagonistic and I know, for better and for worse that some of that antagonism has
    dissipated over time, which it has to. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="58" in="00:29:29.05" out="00:30:03.14"> Nicolas: I’m
    gonna admit it wasn’t necessarily best for me that it was so antagonistic. And, some of that
    activism was such a huge part of our class consciousness, class being any of the four years that
    I was there at any given time. And I know that, and from what I’ve heard from students it’s not
    that way anymore. Again, its a plus and a minus so I don’t wanna put judgment on it ‘cause I
    know in the past I would have. However, it’s just one of those things that’s palpable to me as
    I’m talking to students ‘cause it’s so different from when I was here. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="59" in="00:30:03.15" out="00:30:12.23"> Heather: If you
    were writing a history of Grinnell College, what events or just social aspects would you include
    from your time here? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="60" in="00:30:12.24" out="00:30:59.05"> Nicolas: Huh,
    wow. I would... There are a cou- since so much of my experience at Grinnell was based on being a
    student of color, and so much of my energy and focus was on over- helping students and myself
    overcome some of those cultural gaps, I would’ve- there are some situations throughout my four
    years that were very disheartening. Generally, to be perfectly honest and thankfully, I don’t
    actually remember all the incidents. Some of them I do. It’s not necessarily worth mentioning in
    any individual instances but the ones I would always wanna focus on were ones where students
    felt alienated from each other, because it’s always important to see and to note how we failed
    each other as people. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="61" in="00:30:59.06" out="00:31:26.01"> Nicolas: I think
    there are many many instances where we served each other well, and those should be contrasted
    when we didn’t. I feel, it’s always- this is a microcosm of society in some way, shape or form.
    On, y’know, we are academic elite here and that’s very important to emphasize as well, and, on
    many levels, we were both very good people to each other and very bad people to each other and
    that goes for everyone, myself included. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="62" in="00:31:26.02" out="00:32:01.19"> Nicolas: I think
    to fo – to have focuses on those, so that, to emphasize we’re human, we made mistakes and as a
    society and limited to Grinnell, we should always hope to learn from those experiences.
    Specifically ones where people said things in an attempt to be humorous and satirical and it
    almost always failed miserably. And how communication gaps were always central to those issues.
    I think it’d be very important throughout my four years here to emphasize each and every one of
    those. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="63" in="00:32:01.20" out="00:32:31.27"> Nicolas: One
    specifically was when, and this is, I think most important, when- I don’t think it was, I think
    it was a townie, came on campus and spray-painted across various parts of campus anti-Semitic
    propaganda which was a very unfortunate and powerful experience for us here. That was the first
    time I really felt unsafe on campus. I had the door – I was living off-campus at the time in a
    campus-owned house, the first time we- that was when I said "No, doors needs to be locked here
    now, and I need to lock my room." <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="64" in="00:32:31.28" out="00:33:11.13"> Nicolas: Only
    time in my entire four years I ever locked my room. And, on some levels it was very interesting
    to see how we as a campus community came together and how we didn’t. ‘Cause the thing about
    campus that always happens is we’re so busy that we come together for a month and then we get
    overwhelmed by academia. I think, always showing those contrasts and figuring out, and using
    those to figure out ways how we can assist students as alumni to keep those types of energies
    going to say "We are solidary. We are together and respective of whatever cultural differences
    we have." I think that’s just very important to me. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="65" in="00:33:11.14" out="00:33:15.28"> Heather: I don’t
    have any more questions. Do you have anything else you'd like to add? <speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="66" in="00:33:15.29" out="00:34:10.03"> Nicolas: I
    always had, when I was here, a love-hate relationship with Grinnell. It was very hard being an
    urban New Yorker, coming to rural Iowa and it permeated so much of my experience in sometimes
    very negative ways, in sometimes very positive ways. But I think the most powerful thing for me
    insofar as how I look back at Grinnell was, when I came back for my last cluster reunion I sat
    back and said, “OK, these are all the negative things that lingered over time.” Some of it I
    took, most of it I ended up having to take- not having to take- I chose to take responsibility
    for. And I forgave my own experiences here and I think it has allowed me to really, truly
    appreciate all the wonderful things I had here that I wasn’t able to do when I first graduated
    ‘cause I had some significantly negative experiences here relating to my fellow students.
    <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="67" in="00:34:10.04" out="00:34:49.03"> Nicolas: I think
    it’s- if there’s anything I would ever wanna leave to any of my peers, either current students
    or future students is, and/or alumni is, the best thing I ever did insofar as truly being able
    to appreciate all the wonderful things I experienced here was to forgive the ones that weren’t
    so nice. Just, for example, the one I just mentioned earlier insofar as the anti-Semitic
    propaganda, and everything else that happened. I think, it’s always important to appreciate the
    opportunity I got here because this place really did foment so many good things in me as a human
    being and it really empowered me to do the other things I did as an adult that really have made
    me a better human being. <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="68" in="00:34:49.04" out="00:35:57.07"> Nicolas: I’m a
    better person for having come here, and being able to look back and say, "There was some good.
    There was some bad," and overall it was a very positive experience for me and being able to
    constantly remember and appreciate that because I didn’t get to do so the last time I visited
    and I feel like now that I’m here and I’m really looking around and really being able to look
    much more fondly on things, even when they were miserable experiences. Almost all, many of which
    were self-inflicted i.e., "Oh, I have a paper tomorrow and I have to write all 12 of them and I
    have one." Some of those very self-inflicted painful experiences, being able to look back and
    say, "Wow that really wasn’t very smart of me," and then being able to also look back and say,
    "This is where I had this conversation that changed my life in this way or in that way," really
    gave me a very positive perspective on things. It’s really nice to be able to do that much more
    in-depth this time around. And, this place is great and I always have to remember all the
    wonderful things that I did here because I would not be as good a human being as I am now had it
    not been for my experience at Grinnell <speaker>Nicolas Schapira</speaker></scene>
  <scene id="69" in="00:35:57.08" out="00:35:59.01"> Heather: Wow.
    Well, thanks so much.<speaker>Heather Riggs</speaker></scene>
